asclepius-binding-hippocratic-oath-progress-0 = I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this covenant:
asclepius-binding-hippocratic-oath-progress-1 = I will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures that are required, avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism.
asclepius-binding-hippocratic-oath-progress-2 = I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings, those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm.
asclepius-binding-hippocratic-oath-progress-3 = If I do not violate this oath, may I enjoy life and art, respected while I live and remembered with affection thereafter. May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience the joy of healing those who seek my help.

asclepius-binding-inhuman = The snake carving seems to come alive, if only for a moment, before returning to it's dormant state, almost as if it finds you incapable of holding it's oath.
asclepius-binding-bound = You can't possibly handle the responsibility of more than one rod!
asclepius-binding-hippocratic-oath-complete = The wooden snake that was carved into the rod seems to suddenly come alive and begins to slither down your arm! The compulsion to help others grows abnormally strong...
asclepius-binding-hippocratic-oath-cancelled = The snake seems unsatisfied with your incomplete oath and returns to it's previous place on the rod, returning to its dormant, wooden state.
