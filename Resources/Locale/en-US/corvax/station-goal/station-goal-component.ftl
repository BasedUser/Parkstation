station-goal-fax-paper-name = Цель станции
station-goal-shuttle =
    The goal of your shift is to build a manned shuttle in space and provide it with everything it needs to survive.
    To fulfill this goal, the service department needs to order all the necessary resources for the engineering and scientific departments.
    The engineering department needs to build it, and the science department needs to provide the engineering department and the shuttle with all the necessary equipment.
station-goal-singularity =
    The goal of your shift is to build a generator based on the supermassive Singularity.
    To accomplish this, the service department must provide all necessary materials needed to the engineering department, the engineers will need to build a containment cage.
    The containment cage must be able to contain the singularity up to power level 3.
station-goal-solar-panels =
    The purpose of your shift is to organize a backup power system for the station based on solar panels.
    To do this, you will need to order all the necessary materials from the service department and then build 2 new branches of solar panels by the engineering department.
    And also to ensure the isolation and safety of the energy they produce, they must go in 3 new SMES stations not connected to the main power network.
station-goal-artifacts =
    The goal of your shift is to discover, explore and deliver space artifacts.
    Its completion will require the salvage workers to search for and deliver artifacts from the wreckage and around the station.
    After delivery, they must be transferred in a special container to the science department for study and documentation of their properties.
    It is necessary to deliver at least 2 fully studied and documented artifacts on the evacuation shuttle in special containers.
    Recommended paragraphs of the document describing the artifact:
    - Object name
    - Description of the object appearance
    - Object properties
    - Extra notes
    - FI and position of the person in charge
    The document must be certified with a stamp from the research supervisor.
station-goal-bank =
    The goal of your shift is to build an orbital storage facility with supplies and technology.
    The storage should be placed in space separately from the main station, make sure its design is strong, a random meteorite should not damage it.
    4 boxes must be placed in the storage:
    - Advanced medicines
    - Stocks of the best seeds
    - Food cooler box with high nutritional value
    - Valuable, but not unique circuit boards
    Monitor the safety of the contents in the storage until the end of the shift.
station-goal-zoo =
    The purpose of your shift is to improve the recreation of the personnel at the station.
    The engineering department needs to build a zoo in close proximity to the dormatoriums with at least three enclosures of different types of animals ordered from the service department.
    Provide animals with food, at least one cleaning robot in each enclosure, and everything necessary for life, depending on the type of animal.
