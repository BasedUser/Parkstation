<!--
If applicable, add screenshots or videos to showcase your PR.
This makes it much easier for us to merge PRs.
Refactors or small fixes are exempt, but all PRs which make in-game changes (adding clothing, items, new features, etc) must include in-game media or the PR will not be merged.

Use screenshot software like Windows's built-in snipping tool, ShareX, Lightshot, or recording software like ShareX (gif), ScreenToGif, or Open Broadcaster Software (cross-platform).

If you're unsure whether your PR will require media, ask a maintainer.

Here you can fill out a changelog that will automatically be added to the game when your PR is merged.
There are 4 icons for changelog entries: add, remove, tweak, fix.

You can put your name after the :cl: symbol to change the name that shows in the changelog.
Like so:
:cl: PJB

Generally, only put things in changelogs that players actually care about.
Stuff like "Refactored X system, no changes should be visible" shouldn't be on a changelog.

For writing actual entries, don't consider the entry type suffix (e.g. add) to be "part" of the sentence:
bad: - add: a new tool for engineers
good: - add: Added a new tool for engineers

- remove: Removed fun!
