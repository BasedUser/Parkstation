## Contributing

We are happy to accept contributions from anybody. Get in Discord if you want to help. We've got a [list of issues](https://github.com/orgs/Park-Station/projects/1/views/1) that need to be done and anybody can pick them up. Don't be afraid to ask for help either!

We are not currently accepting translations of the game on our main repository. If you would like to translate the game into another language consider creating a fork or contributing to a fork.
